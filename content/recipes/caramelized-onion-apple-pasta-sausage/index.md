A few notes. Make sure the sausage gets deeply browned. Caramelizing the onions takes way longer than the recipe calls 
for. Use very low heat and allow for at least an hour to caramelize the onions. Add extra thyme and red pepper flakes to 
taste. Make sure to save lots of pasta water for the final steps.
