Recipe is from [In Bloom Bakery](https://inbloombakery.com/chewy-pumpkin-cookies/)

The recipe makes about 20 cookies using a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop. The recipe recommends cooking 6
cookies at a time. The cookie balls can be made slightly larger for 18 cookies by cooking 3 batches
of six. 

I have found 8 cookies can fit on a sheet. Make two full batches of exactly 2 tablespoon cookies. 
Then any remaining dough can be baked in a small third batch to get the full 20 cookies.
