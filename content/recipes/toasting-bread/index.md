              bowl. Attach the paddle attachment to the stand mixer and set to low 
              speed. Mix until combined. Turn off mixer and let sit for three minutes

      - name: Prepare Loaf Pan
        text: Grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan with vegetable oil spray. (I like 
              to use a cast iron pan to get extra browning on the bread crust). Pour 
              the dough into the pan and press into corners and smooth the top.
        ingredients: 
          - oil_spray
      - name: Rise
        text: Cover the pan and let rise for about an hour. It is done rising when 
              the dough has just risen above the top of the pan. Heat the oven to
              {{< temperature 400 >}} while the dough is rising.
  - section_name: Bake

              the internal temperature is at least {{< temperature 190 >}}.
      - name: Cool
        text: Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Remove from the
              pan and fully cool on a cooling rack.

This bread was inspired by 
[King Arthur's English Muffin Toasting Bread](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/english-muffin-toasting-bread-recipe).

I modified it to include more whole grains and seeds to be a healthy bread to eat for breakfast. Toast it up and eat with
peanut butter and jam. I like to eat it with Kirkland Signature Mixed Nut Butter.

The ingredients call for specific King Arthur products because that is what I use and know works. However, they can be 
substituted for anything similar.
