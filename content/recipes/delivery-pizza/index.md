Most pizza recipes are for a specific regional United States variety of pizza like New York, or a type of Italian
pizza that requires a special oven. This recipe instead is for the type of pizza that is delivered from the major
pizza chains that doesn't really fit into another style.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOeCLN9VHGY) from Brian Lagerstrom shows all the steps to make the 
pizza and has the recipe written in the description.

The ingredients below don't specify toppings. Make a classic pepperoni pizza as shown in the video or add your
favorite toppings to order on delivery pizza.
