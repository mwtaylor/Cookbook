This recipe works best cooked in a 12 inch cast iron skillet. If that is not available another oven safe skillet can be used, or transfer from skillet to another oven safe dish before 
topping with potatoes.

A lot of instructions in this recipe are not exact, so taste frequently.

Pairs well with the rest of the red wine not used in the recipe.

The Bachan's sauce can be substituted for Worcestershire sauce if needed. The idea to use Bachan's Japanese barbecue sauce instead of the more traditional Worcestershire sauce comes from [Bachan's recipe](https://bachans.com/blogs/recipes/bachans-cottage-pie). 
I also took inspiration from [Tastes Better From Scratch](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/cottage-pie/) for instructions on how to make a traditional cottage pie.
