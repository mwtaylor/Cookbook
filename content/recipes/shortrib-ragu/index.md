Inspired by [Le Creuset](https://www.lecreuset.com/italian-beef-ragu/LCR-2617.html) and
[Plays Well With Butter](https://playswellwithbutter.com/short-rib-ragu-recipe/)

This recipe can also be made with a beef roast instead of short ribs. Trim any large
pieces of hard fat. Cut the roast into steak slices and brown both sides in the Dutch 
oven. Cut into 2-inch cubes after browning. Otherwise, follow the recipe as written.
