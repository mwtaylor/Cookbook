I use this recipe from [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/buttermilk-pancakes-recipe) for simple pancakes. 
I also use techniques from their blog post to 
[make fluffy pancakes](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2019/01/21/how-to-make-fluffy-pancakes).

It works well to make a half batch by dividing all ingredients in half.

Use two eggs for one full batch or 1 egg for a half batch. Divide the egg and whip the whites and gently fold them in after resting 
the batter.
