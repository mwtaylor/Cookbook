        ingredients:

        text: Drain the beans and fill the pot with more water, enough to cover the beans
              by about two inches. Simmer until starting to be tender and almost done, about an hour. 
              There will be a little more cooking later so don't overcook to avoid mushy beans. 
              Save the bean cooking water for use later. Move on to the next step and 
              cook the beans and tomatoes simultaneously.

[This was inspired by this recipe from the Mediterranean Dish](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/white-beans-recipe/)

Most of the ingredients I do not follow the recipe exactly and instead just
go by taste.

I made this with Alubia Blanca beans from 
[Rancho Gordo](https://www.ranchogordo.com/collections/heirloom-beans/products/alubia-blanca-de-san-jose-iturbide)
and they worked really well in this recipe.
